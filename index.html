    <p>
      Yeah what a breakthrough, i am interested in coding. Rn i haven’t been gaming much lately,
      yes i am a fan of hyper light drifter, no i haven’t played it (if my future self isn’t too
      retarded he’ll probably make the background about it(sup future that guy talking...well i indeed was too retarded)). As you must’ve noticed this is quite
      blank. Just us with our thoughts, looking at some ahhh template. Anyways ig.

        <h3>What i learned about coding so far</h3>
        <p>
          Am into web dev (i keep just saying obvious stuff bruh).
          <em>Anyways</em> i digress (as would thr drinker say).
          So, so far i learned some python, some javascript, html, css.
          (I’ll probably be too lazy to update this page like lmao i’ll probably just turn it into my
          portfolio after making it <em>respectable</em>)
        </p>

      <div class="col-6 col-12-small">
        <h3>Ambition?</h3>
        <p>
          I really wanna start upwork when i get confidence / do 2 to 3 projects + make this my portfolio.
          I aim at 5, 10 to 20 bucks gigs smth like "Hey, make me a homepage".
          Then i can lvl up in web dev, do harder stuff, network idk.
        </p>

      <div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
        <h3>Game dev? (probably start in less than 6 months from now)</h3>
        <p>
          I wanna make a smth like Omori / hyper light drifter (it’s a huge source of inspiration for me).
          I wanna make my game’s core strength switching btw pixel art and vector-based art style
          as an artistic and narrative choice. The game is gonna be made in Unity free plan I think,
          and the language will be C# (I’ll learn it in time).
